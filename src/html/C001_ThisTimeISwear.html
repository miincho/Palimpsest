			<h1>THIS TIME I SWEAR.</h1>
			<h2>Wednesday, June 19, 2024.</h2>
			<p>
				During our junior year at Parsons School of Design, Mink and I promised
				to complete a project together. It is currently June, and we are a few
				sessions in.
			</p>
			<p>To catch you up to speed:</p>
			<p>
				While brainstorming during Meeting #1, we decided that fearlessness and
				accountability were at the heart of the Palimpsest Passion Project, or
				PPP. Meeting #2 was about concept refinement and organization. We
				presented mood boards and discussed how we saw PPP. From there, we
				planned to have Figma sketches ready for Meeting #3. And now,
				post-meeting, we have a solid direction. Concerning content, we will
				contribute “articles,” which can mean anything from finding quotes,
				writing captions or notes, or sourcing visual references. PPP is an
				inspiration archive.
