					<h1>WHAT'S COOKING, GOOD LOOKING.</h1>
					<h2>Wednesday, September 18, 2024.</h2>
					<p>Hello, Palimpsest. Long time no see. How have you been?</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						Since we last met, Mink and I started our senior year at Parsons
						School of Design! Time flies. I cannot believe this is our last year
						of undergraduate studies. There is this bittersweet feeling.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						At the moment, I am procrastinating on my homework assignments for
						American Art (PLAH 4035 - A) and Communication Design Studio: Motion
						Graphics (PSAM 2440 - A). Okay, I am totally procrastinating.
						Actually, I take that back. I am simply doing a stimulating mental
						exercise to keep my mind sharp for the long night ahead. Yeah. It
						has been a while since I opened up Visual Studio Code. Also, I had
						some random thoughts I had to jot down to re-focus on annotating. I
						read the word <em>cincture</em> which distracted me because I had to
						look up its definition. I have also been meaning to write down a
						list of scents.
					</p>
					<br></br>
