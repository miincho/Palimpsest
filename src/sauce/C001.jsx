            <p>
                During our junior year at Parsons School of Design, Mink and I promised
                to complete a project together. It is currently June, and we are a few
                sessions in.
            </p>
            <p>To catch you up to speed:</p>
            <p>
                While brainstorming during Meeting #1, we decided that fearlessness and
                accountability were at the heart of the Palimpsest Passion Project, or
                PPP. Meeting #2 was about concept refinement and organization. We
                presented mood boards and discussed how we saw PPP. From there, we
                planned to have Figma sketches ready for Meeting #3. And now,
                post-meeting, we have a solid direction. Concerning content, we will
                contribute “articles,” which can mean anything from finding quotes,
                writing captions or notes, or sourcing visual references. PPP is an
                inspiration archive.
            </p>
            <p>THIS TIME I SWEAR to commit.</p>
